I still remember when I had completed my React playlist and wanted to build a project.  
Most project ideas felt boring — school management systems, counters, todo apps.

I wanted to build something **unique**.

That’s when I came across a **Video to GIF converter** using the **FFmpeg WASM library**.  
I was excited, and I actually built it.

I won’t deep dive into who made FFmpeg, why it was made, or its pros and cons — you can search that on Google.

In this blog, I’ll explain **how FFmpeg works internally** and how it converts one file type into another.

In simple terms, FFmpeg works in **5 steps**.

---

## 1. Demuxing

Demuxing means FFmpeg uses **demuxers** to split your input file into multiple streams.

A stream is simply a continuous flow of data inside a media file, such as:
- video stream
- audio stream

---

## 2. Decoding

In this step, the input file is converted into **raw frames**:
- Video → raw pixel frames
- Audio → raw PCM samples

Each video frame is basically an image.  
Most editing and processing can only happen on this raw data.

---

## 3. Filtering

Filtering receives raw data from the decoder and sends filtered output to the encoder.

This step can be optional.

Common uses:
- resizing
- deinterlacing (fixing combed images to make them clearer)

---

## 4. Encoding

Here, raw data is converted into **compressed packets**.

Encoding is usually **lossy**, meaning quality is reduced to decrease file size.  
Some encoders are lossless, but they produce much larger files.

---

## 5. Muxing

This is the final stage.

Muxing repackages all processed streams back into **one single output file**, keeping everything in sync.

---

## Example FFmpeg Command

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf "scale=1280:720" -c:v libx265 -c:a aac output.mp4
```

### What happens internally:

- **Demuxing**: input.mkv splits into video + audio streams  
- **Decoding**: video → raw frames, audio → raw PCM samples  
- **Filtering**: video resized to 1280×720  
- **Encoding**: video → H.265 (HEVC), audio → AAC  
- **Muxing**: final MP4 file → output.mp4
